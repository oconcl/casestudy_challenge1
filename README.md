    * ComplyAdvantage attempts to lessen the frequency of companies losing money due to fraud and helps prevent fraud in real-time. ComplyAdvantage software detects transactions originating from suspicious locations, currencies or deviations in behavior along with transactions from new accounts. ComplyAdvantage claims to improve compliance workload efficiency, reduce false positives by 70% and shorten onboarding cycle time by 50%. The software allows for reduction and repursuing of human resource costs, which can lead to an increase in margins, overall [(source).](https://www.arizton.com/market-reports/us-regtech-market) 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
    * ComplyAdvantage does not publically make available its customer base reports; however, Aritzon believes the RegTech consumer market size in 2022 was $2.55 billion and will be $8.21 billion by 2028. The RegTech industry is most prevalent in the financial sector, where financial institutions use SaaS (software as a service). The financial services industry has experienced a 500%+ increase in regulatory and compliance changes since 2008 which makes the business a prime customer for RegTech. The company's intended consumer focus is mainly on the banking sector but is not limited to banking. High Gear states that cybersecurity is another sector that has a high need for RegTech. Antivirus software or VPN providers face a rapidly changing environment and have a need to store and transfer highly sensitive data which makes the sector a prime client for RegTech companies [(source).](https://www.highgear.com/blog/who-uses-regtech/)

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
    * ComplyAdvantage offers a perpetual KYC check in real-time. It enables its clients to detect financial crime early on which increases efficiency and decreases fees or silos. ComplyAdvantage offers real-time sanctions and watchlist screening using global lists from OFAC, EU, UN and other governmental and regulatory databases. Given the ability for ComplyAdvantage's software to monitor transactions in real-time, it allows clients to detect these transactions before they are processed [(source.)](https://salv.com/blog/complyadvantage-alternatives-competitors/)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)
    * Founder of ComplyAdvantage, Charles Delingpole, states that the company was born in the cloud, so they work with a dynamic tech stack that includes Amazon Web Services (AWS), Terraform, Kubernetes, GitLab, Datadog, and Argo [(source.)](https://complyadvantage.com/careers-in-technology/#:~:text=ComplyAdvantage%20was%20born%20in%20the,clients%2C%20our%20needs%20are%20evolving.)

## Landscape
* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
    * ComplyAdvantage is involved in the Regulatory Technology (RegTech) business. It uses SaaS to help businesses comply with regulations efficiently and less expensively within the financial services industry. The customer base of this company is generally FinTech companies, ranging from start-ups to more established names. Andrew Yuille, head of Risk Business Solutions at Thomson Reuters said “RegTech is looking at how institutions, banks, insurance companies or even regulated entities can comply with regulation and do it in a more efficient way, FinTech is looking at innovative solutions, typically for consumers, in the little gaps left by financial services organizations, bigger banks or insurance businesses.” The FinTech evolution has created many innovations that led to a large demand for RegTech solutions [(source).](https://www.apiax.com/resources/guides/regtech-guide/#:~:text=Regtech%2C%20or%20RegTech%2C%20consists%20of,also%20known%20as%20regulatory%20technology.%E2%80%9D)

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?
    * Deloitte states that over the recent years, the complexity of procedures and controls required by corporate governance has grown enormously, resulting in complex processes. The sector has pushed towards a gradual transformation from which the need for innovative solutions has arisen. While “RegTech” is a recent phenomenon, the global market size is expected to grow $11.9 billion to $19.5 billion total, by 2026. 
    *The five major trends that have dominated RegTech and are expected to continue their prominence in the industry are product & service governance, auto QA, AI driven data management, blockchain & DLT, and open data & APIs. 
        1. Product & service governance: regulatory officers are closely monitoring the processes and frameworks that ensure a company’s products are developed and managed to meet shareholder and consumer expectations. Some of the RegTech implementations have been software that tracks a complete history of a product and keeps documentation of any events or records relating to the product’s governance. This allows for less manual intervention of reporting, filing and storage. 
        2. Auto QA: quality assurance currently relies heavily on human intervention. Most QA processes involve listening to calls, outlining objectives and subjective assessments. Automated QA services allow for more thorough reviews while simultaneously decreasing the manual work required from employees. 
        3. AI driven data management: AI tools can monitor and analyze large volumes of data to identify trends. AI can manage activities like data cleansing, data integration and governance. Another added benefit is risk data management to identify potential risks to the firm. 
        4. Blockchain & Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT): firms can improve transparency and security of risk management processes, like trade settlement and regulatory reporting. They do this by creating tamper-proof ledgers to reduce fraud. This technology is particularly useful for transactions involving multiple parties or transfers of large amounts of data. 
        5. Open data & APIs: the integration of technology to allow RegTech software to be intertwined increases efficacy of the compliance and improves monitoring efforts. It also can help firms show regulators and stakeholders the appropriate data to confirm they are operating in a responsible manner [(source 1).](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/it/Documents/strategy/open-innovation-regtech-eng.pdf) [(source 2).](https://fintech.global/2023/01/26/5-biggest-technology-innovations-in-regtech/)
